DOOM 2D TO DO LIST

1) set up pause menu. currently, cursor is locked and hidden at start. player unlocks cursor by pressing esc, and can relock again by clicking. We want to set up a full pause menu. 
	Current code for locking/unlocking cursor is in GameManager.cs
	Current functions for this are private. if doing own pause menu in seperate script, might need to make them public.
	Also, currently have GameManager.cs script on the player UI object. This will need to change if i will not always be using UI.
2) Give player melee attack - 
	Since player uses ammo, will need melee attack in case runs out of ammo
3) Set up main menu - Check this link to set something up: https://www.udemy.com/course/unitymenus/
	- Create Main Menu Scene pixel art (instead of black background)
	- Make sure to set firstLevel variable to the actual first level in the Main Menu scene. Variable is attached to Canvas UI object, MainMenu script.
